# BC

BC is an unofficial open source implementation of the Blizzard Core standard
library circa 2010.

The Blizzard Core standard library is a collection of data structures and
functions created by the talented folks at Blizzard Entertainment for use in
their games.

This project attempts to provide a version of Blizzard Core compatible with
the version used in the final release build of World of Warcraft: Wrath of
the Lich King in 2010: 3.3.5a (12340).

In the spirit of documenting what is presumed to have existed at the time,
this project makes every attempt to maintain the canonical names, layouts, and
side effects of the original implementation of Blizzard Core. At the same
time, it attempts to ensure portability and compatibility with modern 64-bit
systems.

## FAQ

**Why?**

It's fascinating to explore the development practices used to build a modern
major video game.

**Why 3.3.5a?**

The game and its libraries have become significantly more complex in the
intervening 10+ years. By picking 3.3.5a, it's possible to imagine this
implementation will eventually be complete.

**Will this let me cheat in the game?**

No. BC is a standard library, and none of its routines are particularly
relevant to the anti-cheat measures found in the game.

**Can I use this in my own development projects?**

It's probably a bad idea. The original utility classes and routines remain
closed source, and this  project is in no way official.
